# Pizza Sales Analysis: SQL Insights

This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of a pizza sales dataset using SQL. The goal of this project was to derive actionable insights by answering key business questions, ranging from basic sales metrics to more complex, intermediate-level queries.

## ðŸ“Š Project Structure

The analysis is divided into two main sections:

1.  **Basic Analysis:** High-level queries to understand overall performance and identify top sellers.
2.  **Intermediate Analysis:** Deeper-dive queries that involve joins and aggregations to uncover trends and patterns.

### 4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT  pizzas.size, count(order_details.order_detail_id) AS order_count 
FROM order_details
JOIN pizzas ON
pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
GROUP BY size ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

**Key Insight:**
*A brief sentence identifying the most frequently ordered pizza size.*

### 5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT pizza_types.name, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS Total_pizzas_ordered FROM pizza_types
JOIN pizzas ON
pizzas.pizza_type_id = pizza_types.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details ON
order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name
ORDER BY Total_pizzas_ordered DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Key Insight:**
*A brief summary of the top 5 most popular pizzas.*
